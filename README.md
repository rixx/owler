# Owler

Owler is a library to help manage [Problem Euler](https://projecteuler.net) solving programming files, potentially in
multiple languages. You know, no easier way to play around with Rust/Octave/`$LANGUAGE` than trying some Project Euler
problems in it!


## Usage

Only just begun, nothing usable here yet.


## Features

 - create problem solving file(s) in a language of your choice, or multiple languages
 - provide the problem description as comment string in the files
 - load additional data such as images in the problem directory
 - submit your solution to [projecteuler](https://projecteuler.net) or just print the result
 - pre-fetch all problem data to be network independent afterwards
 - usage: command line flags or interactive mode
 - available for installation with `pip`


## Challenges

Project Euler uses a Captcha to prevent people from spamming the server with possible solutions. I'll try to break the
Captcha and avoid misuse of this tool by adding maybe a second of a wait to each submission run - this will make no
difference if you only submit your new solutions, but it *will* prevent mindless spamming.
